# Vizra

### Welcome to Vizra.

>Vizra is a piece of software to analyse audio and create visualisations which can be projected live

*N.B.* I (Ruth/@Rumyra) created Vizra for myself. Now I've gone about in circles with this, and it is to satisfy my own need. Thus meaning it is probably not set up how you would need it.

This is the joy of code, that we can create bespoke software to satisfy our own needs. And it is useful none the less, feel free to poke around the code, use it and ask any questions.

#### Work in progress

This is very much a learning experience for me, I am creating a piece of software solo and it is still a work in progress.

#### Set up

Basic express build, so run npm install once you have cloned the repo. The more I build on this the more I will expand on this readme üôèüèª
